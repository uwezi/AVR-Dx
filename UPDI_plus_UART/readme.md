# UPDI
The new AVR chips use a single-wire serial programming interface UPDI. There are plenty of sources on the web on how to build an avrdude-compatible programmer
using just a standard USB-UART TTL dongle.

But now I took the general idea of my USBasp clone which I had developed for my students about 10 years ago, where the programmer snaps onto the breadboard and 
automatically provides power to the breadboard's side rails as well. As usual I let [PCBgogo](https://www.pcbgogo.com/) manufacture my 2-layer boards and was very satisfied 
with their services.

The design uses the lesser known [CH342K](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Postcard/assets/component_documentation/CH342%20Datasheet.pdf) 
which can be sourced from LCSC and Aliexpress for about â‚¬ 1,50 a piece - I found no "western" source for this chip. The chip is similar to the 
CH340-series of USB-UARTs, but it even contains two independent serial ports in a single 10pin SMD package with an exposed pad on the underside, it needs no external oscillator and
it seems to be already supported by all modern operating systems.

# Files
You can find the KiCAD and gerber files in this directory.

There is also an OpenSCAD design and .stl files for a case for the programmer when you do not intend to use it on a breadbaord.
