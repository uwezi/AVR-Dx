A library to use the transflexive 84x48 pixel display from the Nokia 5110 phone.

These displays are readily available on market places like Aliexpress.

Some of the displays need a carefully adjusted contrast voltage using the VOP parameter,
other, possibly newer ones, show a clear contrast with any setting for this parameter.
